# Validation harness (how we know a change is better, not a regression)

Two tools, both offline/fast/deterministic per seed:
- **`ff backtest`** (the trustworthy one for CHAMPIONSHIPS): drafts on a past season's projections,
  then plays a real head-to-head season + playoffs on that season's ACTUAL weekly results ->
  reports our **championship rate**. Weekly variance, byes, and single-elim playoffs are real, so it
  rewards the RIGHT thing.
- **`ff sim`** (fast season-points proxy): one draft, score by starting-lineup season points. Handy
  for quick iteration, but it over-rewards top-heavy rosters (no playoffs) -- prefer backtest for
  strategy calls.

## `ff backtest` -- optimize championship wins (2024)

`npm run ff -- backtest --n 800 [--starter-reserve N --max-share F --premium N]`
Draft with 2024 values (data/values-2024.csv, from data/points-2024.csv), simulate the 2024 season
(weeks 1-14) + playoffs (top 6, weeks 15-17) on real weekly points (data/weekly.csv). Lineups are set
each week by projection, scored by ACTUAL, and a bye/injured starter can't play -> DEPTH matters.

**Projection UNCERTAINTY (the key knob, default sd 0.30):** everyone drafts on a NOISY projection of
the season (a stud can be mis-projected), scored by the real weekly truth. Without it the draft has
perfect foresight and trivially rewards concentration; with it, buying "studs" carries real bust risk.

### Run it across MANY seasons (essential -- single seasons overfit)

`ff backtest --seasons 2014-2024 --n 150` loops every season in `data/history-{points,weekly}.csv`
(built by `tools/build_history.py`) and aggregates. **Always use the multi-season number** -- a
single season's championship estimate swings 25%<->50% for the SAME config just on seed/sample
noise, so single-season "findings" are overfit (I made that mistake: a 2024-only run showed
"reserve 5 = 50.6%, optimal", which did NOT replicate -- 2024 at high N is ~25%).

### What 11 seasons (2014-2024) actually show
Championship rate, ~1650 sims/config (random = 6.3%):
- reserve 5 / max-share 0.6 (default): **27.3%**
- over-balanced (reserve 20 / 0.25): 27.6%
- max stars-and-scrubs (premium 30 / 0.85): 27.9%
- moderate (reserve 10 / 0.45): 27.7%

**The aggression dial is roughly NEUTRAL for championships across seasons (~27%, all within noise).**
Its effect is real within any one season but washes out across seasons -- so do NOT over-tune it.

**Where the edge actually is:** our team wins ~27% of titles = **4.4x the 6.3% random baseline**, and
makes the playoffs ~92% of the time, REGARDLESS of config. That edge comes from drafting rational
values against a field that OVERPAYS for studs (your league's real tendency) -- not from the
stars-and-scrubs vs balanced choice. So: keep a sane MODERATE default (reserve 5-8, max-share
0.5-0.6) for steadiness (balanced has the widest bad-year swings), invest in better VALUES + keeping
our discipline vs the room, and don't chase a "perfect" aggression setting -- there isn't one.

## `ff sim` (season-points proxy)

## What it does

1. Loads a **projection** table (`data/points.csv`) and OUR **values** (`data/values.csv`).
2. Drafts 16 teams: **our team uses the REAL `makeV2Strategy`** (so the sim validates production
   code, not a copy); the 15 bots bid a market model anchored to true value but **overpaying for
   studs** (calibrated to seacaptaindate.com's tendencies -- docs/league-tendencies.md).
3. **Projection RISK:** each player's REALIZED points = projection x (1 + noise, sd 35%). A stud
   can bust. This is what makes concentration risky and balance valuable -- without it the sim has
   perfect foresight and trivially favors buying the priciest studs.
4. Scores every team by its best legal STARTING-lineup realized points, and reports our roster's
   points, average finish (of 16), and 1st / top-3 rate, averaged over N seeds.

Run: `npm run ff -- sim --n 300 [--values FILE] [--starter-reserve N --max-share F --premium N]`

## The regression-guard workflow

Change one thing (a value table, a strategy param), run `ff sim --n 300` before and after:
- **our starting pts up + avg finish down (toward 1) = better.**
- pts down / finish up = **regression** -- revert.
Use N>=300 so seed noise averages out; compare the same N.

## What it found (and how the guidance evolved)

The harness repeatedly corrected intuition -- which is the point:
- **From tendencies alone I guessed "go fully balanced." Wrong.** Over-balance (reserve 20,
  max-share 0.25) finishes WORST in every run.
- On the **2024-actuals** proxy, MODERATE won (reserve ~8, ~$95 on top 3).
- On the **forward-looking 2025 projections** (steep top, deep 16-team No-PPR), **CONCENTRATION
  wins** -- more aggression -> better finish (reserve 2 / max-share 0.8 / $181-on-3 finished ~2.6
  vs ~3.5 for moderate). This MATCHES the league's real behavior (61% of picks are $1-5).
- **Default = aggressive-lean but not extreme** (reserve 5, max-share 0.6, premium 2; ~$120 on the
  top 3). The optimum is INPUT-SENSITIVE, so re-run `ff sim` on the final projections before the
  draft and pick the config -- don't hardcode faith in one run.

## Known limitation to weigh (why we don't just go max-aggression)

Scoring = sum of the starting lineup's realized points. This likely **over-rewards top-heavy
rosters**: it counts a $1 replacement WR2 as "some points" without fully penalizing that a lineup
of 3 studs + 6 waiver-level starters has a low weekly floor and loses head-to-head matchups the
season-sum metric can't see. So treat "max stars-and-scrubs wins" as an upper bound; the default
keeps real depth. A future harness upgrade: simulate weekly head-to-head wins, not season points.

## Honest limits (so we don't over-trust it)

- The **bot model and the 35% projection noise are assumptions**; the ABSOLUTE numbers (e.g. "50%
  firsts") are inflated because the bots are simple. Trust the RELATIVE comparison between configs,
  not the absolute win rate.
- Scoring truth = `data/points.csv`, now **2025 forward-looking projections** (FantasyPros redraft
  consensus ranks mapped onto a 2024 No-PPR points-by-rank curve -- `tools/build_projections.py`).
  Independent of ESPN. A true multi-source projection (ffanalytics / a projections API) would sharpen
  it further; the harness workflow is unchanged.
- The sim does not model nomination gamesmanship, keepers, or in-season waivers.
